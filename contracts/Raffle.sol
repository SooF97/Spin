    /* main features ti respect in this contract : 
        1- users who wanna participate must pay an entrancy price = 5$ BUSD
        2- after reaching 21 players we should pick a random winner from the 21 players
        3- the process of re-launching the game should be automated
        4- the winner must pay a fee of 25% in order to be able to withdraw his funds gained in the lottery
        5- we gonna use 3 main functions :
            - function enterRaffle() {} : anyone who pays the entry 5$ BUSD
            - function pickWinner() {} : automatically pick the winner after reaching 21 players 
            - function withdrawFunds() {} : the winner can withdraw funds if he pays 25% in fees to the smart contract
